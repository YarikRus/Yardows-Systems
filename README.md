Yardows History:

On January 6, 2023, YarikRus (from now I) has an idea to create his OS on python, calling it Yardows, And in 1 hour the version of Yardows 1.0 appeared, then the idea to create a graphic design appears, in 2 hours it is made, Version: Yardows 2.0, then it immediately became clear to me that this is not a FUCKING OS, so I was flipping through YouTube and something happened that I'm proud of: I found a video how to create an OS in C# using Cosmos OS, I started making Yardows RC (in the future C-BGDP) and then after 2 days I changed the name of the project, and On February 7, 2023 I released Yardows C-BGDP 3 days later I released update 2F23 1.0 then a week later I released 2F23 1.1B, on February 12 I thought to make Yardows GS 1.0(in the future 3.0) which is being done to this day 2 updates are also being released and now version C-BGDP 4F23 3.0B is being made, History not finished!

The OS was created for its own country (the Russian Federation), which did not ask, but there was a desire for its Discord-rp-state - the Yaroslavl Republic
